# X-ray and CT Image Segmentation with Novel Neural Network Model

This repository contains the code for image segmentation on X-ray and CT images using a novel neural network architecture.

## Files

- `data.py`: Contains functions to load and preprocess the dataset.
- `ourmodel.py`: Defines the architecture of the neural network model.
- `training.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training the model on the dataset.
- `evaluate.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for evaluating the trained model.
- `split.pkl`: Dataset split file used to separate training and testing data.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CXLNET.git
cd xray-ct-image-segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
